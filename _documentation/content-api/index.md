title: Rivet Content API
summary: The Content API allows you to access the assets your customers contribute. You can use this API to build your own custom displays.
---
The Rivet Platform allows brands and retailers to collect a variety of engaging user generated content – including rich media (photos and videos), geolocation, and commentary – directly from their customers. Rivet offers a collection of embeddable JavaScript displays that allow brands and retailers to easily display the user generated content on their own websites using only a few lines of code. For those customers in search of a more custom display experience, we offer the Rivet Content API. Customers can use the API to create their own galleries of user generated content and integrate the content anywhere on their website.

The Content API returns user generated content based on an display’s data and moderation configuration. Customers create and configure displays using the Rivet Administrative Interface. The Content API also allows for filtering the results it returns based on tags and location data associated with the content.
{:.section-block}

## Calling the API

You call the API using the following endpoint. This example returns 24 pieces of content starting at the beginning of the results set.

```
https://api.rivet.works/embedded/data/{displayIdentifier}
```

The `displayIdentifier` at the end of the URL is the ID that the Rivet platform assigned to the display. You can also define a unique display key in the Rivet Administrative Interface and use that in the API call. The display key allows for “friendlier” URL formats. Each display key must be unique across the Rivet platform.

There are three ways to affect the results the API returns for a display. You can configure a display using the Rivet Administrative Interface, moderate content using the Rivet Administrative Interface, and [filter results](#filtering_results) in the call to the API. When you configure a display you can specify the sources for the content of a display. You can also configure the publishing mode of a display. If you select "hide response before moderation" as the publishing mode, the Content API will return only approved content.

The Content API never returns rejected content.

### Optional query parameters

|name    |description                                                                                                                                                             |default value|
|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|

{:.table .table-responsive}

**Note:** The limit and offset parameters support paging through content.

### <a name="filtering_results"></a>Filtering results

The Content API allows you to filter results using tags and location data. Tags are assigned to content when users complete a Rivet activity. Also, moderators using the Rivet Administrative Interface can edit the tags for user activity submissions.  Location data is based on the geolocation information provided by the user or that an uploaded photo contains.

Rivet displays use what is called a page context to tell the API how to filter results. The page context is a JSON object that specifies which tags and/or geolocation response content must match for the API to include them in the results. The page context supports a variety of logical expressions for customizing filtering criteria.

For more information about the page context see the section “Website Integration” in the “Rivet Technical Integration Guide.”

Filtering with the Content API is very similar to the display’s page context. The API calls its filtering parameter `qualifier`. Instead of being a JSON object as is the display’s page context, the qualifier for the API is expressed as Rison. The API uses Rison because it is more compact than JSON and better suited for expressing a complex object as a query parameter.

The following is an example of a JSON page context and its corresponding Rison qualifier:

#### JSON

```
"pageContext": {
   "tags": {
    "city": ["Austin", "London"],
    "type": "day"
   },
   "geoRegion": {
    "lat": 40.833333333,
    "lon": 14.25,
    "r": "5 km"
  }
 }
```
#### Rison

```
q=(t:(city:!(Austin,London),type:day),g:(lat:40.833333333,lon:14.25,r:'5 km')
```

**Note:** The Rison qualifier must be URL encoded.
{:.fa-thumbs-up.icon-holder .callout-block .callout-success}


For more information about Rison please see [https://github.com/Nanonid/rison](https://github.com/Nanonid/rison).

### Showing specific content

In addition to filtering it is possible to request specific pieces of content from the API. You can ask for content by its submission identifier. This Rivet Administrative Interface shows submission identifiers in the moderation interface. The submission identifier is also in the response from the Content API at the `identifier.id` path for each data element.

The Content API will return the content you specify regardless of the publishing mode. The Content API never returns rejected content
{:.fa-thumbs-up.icon-holder .callout-block .callout-info}

The following is an example of a JSON page context that asks for two specific pieces of content followed by it's corresponding Rison qualifier:

#### JSON

```
"pageContext": {
  "submissionIds": [
    "4992d848-d0f0-11e5-9577-22000afe5763",
    "7bafdc00-bba0-11e5-9356-22000ae60646"
  ]
 }
```
#### Rison

```
q=(s:!('4992d848-d0f0-11e5-9577-22000afe5763','7bafdc00-bba0-11e5-9356-22000ae60646'))
```

**Note:** The Rison qualifier must be URL encoded.
{:.fa-thumbs-up.icon-holder .callout-block .callout-success}


### Qualifier keys

The qualifier supports three top-level keys for tags, geolocations, and submission identifiers. See the section “Website Integration” in the “Rivet Implementation Guide” for more information about the tags and geoRegion qualifiers.

| name | description                                                    |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| t    | Analogous to the tags key in a display’s page context.         |
| g    | Analogous to the geoRegion key in a display’s page context.    |
| s    | Analogous to the submissionIds key in a display’s page context |
{:.table .table-responsive}

**Note:** While the top-level Rison keys are shortened to make request URLs more compact, the keys of the tags and geoRegion objects are not shortened.
{:.fa-thumbs-up.icon-holder .callout-block .callout-success}

### <a name="sorting_results"></a>Sorting results

The Content API allows you to sort results using a variety of fields. You specify what to sort by using a list of field and sort order pairs. The Content API sorts results by the first field in the sort order list. The API then sorts using the second field within the first and so on.

By default the Content API sorts result by their submission date with the most recent submission first. Specifying a sort replaces the default submission date sort. If you want to sort content by some property and then by submission date, you must include the submission date in your sort order list.

Rivet displays use the page context for specifying the sorting of content. Because of this, sorting using the Content API follows a similar pattern to filtering. Below are examples of specifying a sorting in a page context and the corresponding Rison.

#### JSON

```
"pageContext": {
  "sortOrder": [
    {
      "field": "tags.rank",
      "order": "asc"
    },
    {
      "field": "submissionDate",
      "order": "desc"
    }
  ]
 }
```

#### Rison

```
sort=!((f:tags.rank,o:asc),(f:submissionDate,o:desc))
```

### Sorting keys

The sort order supports two top-level keys for the field to sort by and the order of the sort. See the section “Website Integration” in the “Rivet Implementation Guide” for more information about sorting.

| name | description                                                    |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| f    | Analogous to the field key in a display’s page context.        |
| o    | Analogous to the order key in a display’s page context.        |
{:.table .table-responsive}

### Examples
Below are examples of calls to the API. The qualifier parameters in the examples are not URL encoded for ease of reading. In production use, the qualifier should be URL encoded.

#### Loading the first “page” of content with 24 pieces of content per page:
```
https://api.rivet.works/embedded/data/{displayIdentifier}?limit=24&offset=0
```

#### Loading the second page of content.
Notice that the limit is added to the offset for each page.
```
https://api.rivet.works/embedded/data/{displayIdentifier}?limit=24&offset=24
```

#### Calling the API with a JSONP callback function.
This is how Rivet’s displays most often uses the API. This example results in a call to the window.dataLoaded function with the response from the API as the only parameter. It is up to you to write the callback function.
```
https://api.rivet.works/embedded/data/{displayIdentifier}?limit=24&offset=24&callback=window.dataLoaded
```

#### Using the API with a filter for responses tagged with a cost of two dollars.
```
https://api.rivet.works/embedded/data/rivet-culture-grid?q=(t:(cost:twodollar))
```

#### Tracking your user using the tracking identifier.
```
https://api.rivet.works/embedded/data/{displayIdentifier}?limit=24&offset=24&i=192837
```

#### Getting responses within a 5 mile radius of a location tagged with summer.

```
https://api.rivet.works/embedded/data/{displayIdentifier}?limit=24&offset=24&i=192837&q=(g:(lat:40.833333333,lon:14.25,r:'5 mi'),t:(season:summer))
```

## Responses from the API

The response from the API is a JSON object. Successful responses from the Content API contain the following top–level properties. The other properties at the top level are for Rivet’s use by our display and subject to change.

| name         | description                                                                                                                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| success      | Indicates the success of the API call; true for successful execution and false if there is an error.                                  |
| totalResults | The number of items that the API found for the display that match the search qualifiers.                                                |
| data         | A subset of the results based on the limit and offset. See the next section for more information about the objects in the data array. |
